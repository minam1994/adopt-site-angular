# adopt-site-angular
Project created with Angular, CSS, Bootstrap. Using JSON files that I created.
Adopt project is site about organisation for adoption (cats and dogs). I created components for: navigation, footer, home page, form, cat adoption and dog adoption. I used ngIf to loop through informations about animals on JSON files imported with data service. List of animals are on pages for adoption and when button is clicked under informations about pet, status changes from Available to Reserved.
Form for registation is created to show when input is invalid, with red text under. When is valid, text is changed and other text is showen thanking for registration using username from input.
